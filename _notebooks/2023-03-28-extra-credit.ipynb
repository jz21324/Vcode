    "## Overall Reflection\n",
    "After going to this meeting, I learned that what grade you get in a class does not matter as long as you have a passion for a subject. I have experience of failing in certain classes and giving up in that subject because I feel like I'm not good enough. However, because of this I have learned that I just have to keep on working hard and stay persistent. I also learned that computer science is very important in all fields of STEM so it is good that I am taking a computer science class. I plan on going in the STEM field in the future so it helpful that I am learning these things now to prepare me for my future. Ashley and John also taught me that there are many pathways to success so I shouldn't worry about what others are doing as long as I am doing the best in my own life. This presentation overall made me excited for college because it shows me the many opportunities that there are and all the things that I can learn.\n"
