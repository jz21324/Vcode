Merge Sort . Merge Sort can be used to sort ArrayLists . | Uses a Divide and Conquer algorithm to Sort ArrayList . Divides the array into halves, and then calls itself for the two different halves in order to sort them | merges the two sorted halves into one lists | . | Merging Values into One Sorted Array . copy the original elements into a temporary array | work from left to right in each virtual array to compare element and return them to the correct order in the original array | . | . Way to Think About It: mergeSort (myList) { mergeSort(left); mergeSort(right); mergeSort (left &amp; right) } . First, the mergeSort function splits the ArrayList into half, and then takes the left side of the list. It then calls mergeSort again and then halves the list, and does this two more times. Eventually, it is left with just 5 after sorting using all of mergeSort(left). . . Then, it goes back to the third step with just the 5 and 25, and looks at the right side of that one section. It compares the two halves, 5 and 25, and then sorts it, keeping the 5 before the 25 and recurses its way back to the ArrayList in the beginning. . . We then go back down one more half where we have the 5, 25, 8, and -9. Because we had already sorted the left side of that list, we then go to the right side with the 8 and -9. We then sort the left side where we get 8 and then the right side with -9. . . After this, the mergeSort() sorts -9 and 8 into the right order, and then recurses it once again 8 and -9 with the sorted -9 and 8 instead. . . Because the four of the numbers for the left side of the original list were not in the correct order overall, mergeSort is once again called and the list is sorted with the correct order for just the left side, now containing -9, 5, 8, 25. . . This process is then repeated, but for the right half of the ArrayList. It keeps slitting the list in half, sorting it, and then bringing it to the level below, where eventually, the ArrayList is sorted and merged together, as shown in the image below. . . This is a code segment that CollegeBoard had provided in order to see the recursion behind mergeSort(). The code calls mergeSort() on itself in order to sort the list and merge the halves until you reach the right order and final list. . . Recursion Trees . Recursion trees are a method for visualizing each recursive case (everytime the method is called) until the base case is reached. . Recursive blocks call themselves. In order for them to finish, there must be some special case in which they don&#39;t call themselves. That is the base case, a simpler version of the block&#39;s script that doesn&#39;t call the block itself. . There is usually a conditional with two cases: a base case for the lowest level that stops the recursion from going on forever and a recursive case that calls the block itself at lower levels until it reaches the base case. . Note: If a block keeps recursively calling itself forever, the program is stuck in an infinite loop meaning that there isn&#39;t a base case or it is not accessible. .",

Most tech companies&#39; main goal is to create new innovations that encourage helping people and progressing the world. There will be many challenges in this industry and it is important to be willing to adapt to any obstacles or circumstances. On hard thing that Mr. Porter faced was during the interview process. He was given a problem that needed to be solved with code and only given a limited amount of time to complete it. This has taught me that I need to be able to be quick on my feet and face any problem as well as I can. Another interesting thing I learned was that some tech companies will have training schools that you need to go through once you get a job. This is because the technology they use is specific to that company and cannot be learned from anywhere else. This panal definitely helped me learned a first hand example what the tech industry is like. It also showed me what some future jobs may entail that I am interested in. I am very thankful that they came and broadened my perspective of what my future can be. .",

This process will continue until n = 0 and all the values will be added together. . 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 0 . public static int simpleRecur2(int n) { if (n == 0) return 0; return n + simpleRecur2(n/2); } simpleRecur2(8); . 15 . This one is similar to the last example where it will add the values together but this has multiple recursive methods inside it. So, dblRecur(5) will return 5 + dblRecur(2) + dblRecur(1) and then dblRecur(2) and dblRecur(1) will have their own run through the method until n is no longer greater than 0. . public int dblRecur(int n) { if (n &gt; 0) return n + dblRecur(n/2) + dblRecur(n/3); return 0; } dblRecur(5); . 9 . Recursion can also be seen will String objects. In this, mystery(&quot;computer&quot;) will first go through the mystery(s.substring(2)) which will result in a call stack with &quot;computer&quot;, &quot;mputer&quot;, &quot;uter&quot;, &quot;er&quot;, and &quot; &quot;. THe print statement will then print the first letter of those Strings so e u m c. . public static void mystery (String s) { if (s.length() &gt; 1) { mystery(s.substring(2)); System.out.print(s.substring(0,1)); } } mystery(&quot;computer&quot;); . eumc . 10.2 Binary Search With Equations . We start by taking the entire array, starting with the first and the last numbers, and find the midpoint. Starting number is 0, and end is 40, and the midpoint is 20. . . Since 24 is greater than 20, we take the upper bound of the list, ignoring everything less that 22.The first number now becomes 22. . . We identify the midpoint again, which is 30. Since the new midpoint is higher than 24, we now take the lower bound. Here, the last number becomes 28. . . In this new bound, we find the midpoint again, which happens to be 24. So, we have found our target. . Now, lets say that the target was 23, instead of 24. The program would have to keep going from the midpoint of 24. Since 23 is less than 24, it takes the lower bound. However, this makes first, last and midpoint numbers 22. . . Again, since 22 is less than 23, the first number becomes 24, and the last number stays 22. This becomes a problem since the first number is greater than the last, which is our base case. This tells the program that the number 23 isn’t in the list, and that it should end. . . public class recursion{ public static int recursionBinarySearch(int[] array, int first, int last, int target){ int midpoint; //if the first number is greater than the last, the target number is not in the list if (first &gt; last){ System.out.println(-1); return -1; } else{ midpoint = (first+last)/2; //take the upper bound if number is greater than midpoint if (array[midpoint] &lt; target){ return recursionBinarySearch(array, midpoint+1, last, target); } // take the lower bound if the number is lesser than midpoint if (array[midpoint] &gt; target){ return recursionBinarySearch(array, first,midpoint-1, target); } System.out.println(&quot;index of target: &quot; + midpoint); return midpoint; } } public static void main(String[] args){ // test array in main int[] test_array = new int[]{ 0,2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20,22,24,26,28,30,32,34,36,38,40 }; recursion.recursionBinarySearch(test_array, 0, test_array.length, 24); } } recursion.main(null); . index of target: 12 . Merge Sort . Merge Sort can be used to sort ArrayLists . | Uses a Divide and Conquer algorithm to Sort ArrayList . Divides the array into halves, and then calls itself for the two different halves in order to sort them | merges the two sorted halves into one lists | . | Merging Values into One Sorted Array . copy the original elements into a temporary array | work from left to right in each virtual array to compare element and return them to the correct order in the original array | . | . Way to Think About It: mergeSort (myList) { mergeSort(left); mergeSort(right); mergeSort (left &amp; right) } . First, the mergeSort function splits the ArrayList into half, and then takes the left side of the list. It then calls mergeSort again and then halves the list, and does this two more times. Eventually, it is left with just 5 after sorting using all of mergeSort(left). . . Then, it goes back to the third step with just the 5 and 25, and looks at the right side of that one section. It compares the two halves, 5 and 25, and then sorts it, keeping the 5 before the 25 and recurses its way back to the ArrayList in the beginning. . . We then go back down one more half where we have the 5, 25, 8, and -9. Because we had already sorted the left side of that list, we then go to the right side with the 8 and -9. We then sort the left side where we get 8 and then the right side with -9. . . After this, the mergeSort() sorts -9 and 8 into the right order, and then recurses it once again 8 and -9 with the sorted -9 and 8 instead. . . Because the four of the numbers for the left side of the original list were not in the correct order overall, mergeSort is once again called and the list is sorted with the correct order for just the left side, now containing -9, 5, 8, 25. . . This process is then repeated, but for the right half of the ArrayList. It keeps slitting the list in half, sorting it, and then bringing it to the level below, where eventually, the ArrayList is sorted and merged together, as shown in the image below. . . This is a code segment that CollegeBoard had provided in order to see the recursion behind mergeSort(). The code calls mergeSort() on itself in order to sort the list and merge the halves until you reach the right order and final list. . . Recursion Trees . Recursion trees are a method for visualizing each recursive case (everytime the method is called) until the base case is reached. . Recursive blocks call themselves. In order for them to finish, there must be some special case in which they don&#39;t call themselves. That is the base case, a simpler version of the block&#39;s script that doesn&#39;t call the block itself. . There is usually a conditional with two cases: a base case for the lowest level that stops the recursion from going on forever and a recursive case that calls the block itself at lower levels until it reaches the base case. . Note: If a block keeps recursively calling itself forever, the program is stuck in an infinite loop meaning that there isn&#39;t a base case or it is not accessible. . Example of Recursion Tree . Q: What is the value returned by foo(3)? . A: Use a recursion tree! . . Since the base case of foo returns 1, we can just add up all the function calls that return the base case. . public class example{ static int foo(int n) { if (n &lt; 0){ return 1; } else{ return foo(n-2) + foo(n-1); } } public static void main(String args[]){ System.out.println(foo(3)); } } example.main(null); . 8 . Class Activity . If you are on the left side of the class, you will be working with the factorial code. If you are on the right side of the class, you will be working with the fibonacci code. The objective is to work with your crossover team to act out the recursion tree for the code segments below. The first team from each side to show up the correct recursion tree will receive candy! . TASK: You and your crossover team must physically act out the recursion tree, meaning standing up and each taking a sticky note to represent each branch of the tree. . If you are on the Fibonacci side: You will be acting out fib(3) . If you are on the Factorial side: You will be acting out fact(4) . Fibonacci Code . // Fibonacci Series using Recursion class fibonacci { static int fib(int n) { // Handling base case // iIf value of n=1 or n=0, it returns 1 if (n &lt;= 1) return n; // Generic case // Otherwise we do n-1 + n-2! return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2); } public static void main(String args[]) { // Calling method 1 to compute fibonacci and // storing the result into a variable int n = 3; // Print and display the fibonacci of number // customly passed as an argument System.out.println(&quot;3rd Fibonacci Sequence is: &quot; + fib(n)); } } fibonacci.main(null); . 3rd Fibonacci Sequence is: 2 . Factorial Code . class factorial { static int fact(int n) { // Handling base case // iIf value of n=1 or n=0, it returns 1 if (n == 0 || n == 1) return 1; // Generic case // Otherwise we do n*(n-1)! return n * fact(n - 1); } // Method 2 // main driver method public static void main(String[] args) { // Calling method 1 to compute factorial and // storing the result into a variable int n = 4; // Print and display the factorial of number // customly passed as an argument System.out.println(&quot;Factorial of 4 is: &quot; + fact(n)); } } factorial.main(null); .

The this keyword is the current object in a method or constructor. It is used to invoke the current class, return the current class objet, or pass an argument. . public class Main { int x; // Constructor with a parameter public Main(int x) { this.x = x; } // Call the constructor public static void main(String[] args) { Main myObj = new Main(5); System.out.println(&quot;Value of x = &quot; + myObj.x); } }public class Main { int x; // Constructor with a parameter public Main(int x) { this.x = x; } // Call the constructor public static void main(String[] args) { Main myObj = new Main(5); System.out.println(&quot;Value of x = &quot; + myObj.x); } } . The toString() will represent any object as a string. . class Student{ int rollno; String name; String city; Student(int rollno, String name, String city){ this.rollno=rollno; this.name=name; this.city=city; } public static void main(String args[]){ Student s1=new Student(101,&quot;Raj&quot;,&quot;lucknow&quot;); Student s2=new Student(102,&quot;Vijay&quot;,&quot;ghaziabad&quot;); System.out.println(s1);//compiler writes here s1.toString() System.out.println(s2);//compiler writes here s2.toString() } } . Standard Methods . The equals() method will return true or false depending on whether two strings are equal. . String myStr1 = &quot;Hello&quot;; String myStr2 = &quot;Hello&quot;; String myStr3 = &quot;Another String&quot;; System.out.println(myStr1.equals(myStr2)); // Returns true because they are equal System.out.println(myStr1.equals(myStr3)); // false . true false . A late binding of an object is when the object is determined when the code is ran. . class Animal { void eat(){System.out.println(&quot;animal is eating...&quot;);} } class Dog extends Animal{ void eat() { System.out.println(&quot;dog is eating...&quot;); } public static void main(String args[]) { Animal a=new Dog(); a.eat(); } } . Polymorphism is how a class is able to provide different implementations of a method. It allows you to make the same action in different ways. . Big O notation is what the set of all the different algorithms that is able to run at a certain speed. . To combine two different strings, you can use concatenation which can combine two or more strings to create one new string. . Homework . Homework .",

            "content": "Question 4 Selection with variables x and y . What is printed as a result of executing the code segment? . I chose answer B which was 2.3333 but the value was an integer so this is not a possible answer. The correct answer was C which was 2 because when 7 is divided by 2, you get 2.3333 however, it has to be an integer so it&#39;s 2. . Question 14 Vehicle interface getMileage . Which of the following can be used to replace / expression / so that getTotalMileage returns the total of the miles traveled for all vehicles in the fleet? . I chose the answer D, however the answer is E which is v.getMileage() because it follows the form of object.method(parameters) where v is the object, getMileage is the method, and the parameters is empty. . Question 16 append method with two 1D int arrays . Which of the following expressions can be used to replace / index / so that append will work as intended? . I chose answer B which was k, but the right answer was answer D, k + a1.length, because it needed to have the a1.length included to have the first index as a1.length. . Question 23 manipulate method and animals List . What will the contents of animals be as a result of calling manipulate? . The code segment is supposed to take the element that starts with &quot;b&quot; and move it to index 1. This means that the correct answer is [&quot;bear&quot;, &quot;zebra&quot;, &quot;bass&quot;, &quot;cat&quot;, &quot;koala&quot;, &quot;baboon&quot;]. . Question 25 RBox interfaces . Which of the interfaces, if correctly implemented by a Box class, would be sufficient functionality for a user of the Box class to determine if one Box can fit inside another? . I and II only is the correct answer because choice I gives access to the height, width, and depth of the box with the get methods. Choice II provides smallerHeight, smallerWidth, and smallerDepth methods that let you know whether the box is smaller. . Question 30 scramble method with String and int parameters . What value is returned as a result of the call scramble(&quot;compiler&quot;, 3)? . The correct answer is &quot;ilercom&quot; because the howFar is 3 so the first letter is actually the fourth because the paramater is howFar + 1. The length of the word is 8 - 7 letters so it only returns &quot;ilercom&quot;. . Question 33 Print sum after while loop . What is printed as a result of executing the code segment? . The correct answer is that nothing is printed because it is an infinite loop. This is due to k not being changed so it will always be less than 4 so the expression is always true. . Question 34 Point and Circle Classes . Which of the following replacements for / missing code / will correctly implement the circle constructor? . Choice II gives a new Point with x as a and y as b which makes an actual point. This makes it the only correct answer. . Question 35 Print result after while loop . What is printed as a result of executing the code segment? . The modulus will take the remainder of the value so when 2574 is taken the modulus of 10, 4 will return. It will then go again and return 2, 5, and 7. . Question 38 Compound Boolean expression with variables x and y . Which of the following is equivalent to the expression given above? . Answer A is the correct answer because it will be true if y is greater than 10000 or x is between 1000 and 1500 and if y is greater than 10000, the value will be true. It will still be true if y is not greater than 1000 and x is still in between 1000 and 1500. .",

Boolean If-Then Statement Homework . FRQ 2019 #1 . 1. The APCalendar class contains methods used to calculate information about a calendar. You will write two methods of the class. . (a) Write the static method numberOfLeapYears, which returns the number of leap years between year1 and year2, inclusive. . In order to calculate this value, a helper method is provided for you. . isLeapYear(year) returns true if year is a leap year and false otherwise. | . Complete method numberOfLeapYears below. You must use isLeapYear appropriately to receive full credit. . Answer: . /** Returns the number of leap years between year1 and year2, inclusive. * Precondition: 0 &lt;= year1 &lt;= year2 */ public static int numberOfLeapYears(int year1, int year2) {} int count = 0; for (int i = year1; i &lt;= year2; i++) { if (isLeapYear(i)) { count++; } return count; } } . In this problem I created a loop so that it would go through all the years that are in between year1 and year2. Then inside of that I put a if statement to decide if there was a leap year. If yes, count would be increased by 1. . (b) Write the static method dayOfWeek, which returns the integer value representing the day of the week for the given date (month, day, year), where 0 denotes Sunday, 1 denotes Monday, ..., and 6 denotes Saturday. For example, 2019 began on a Tuesday, and January 5 is the fifth day of 2019. As a result, January 5, 2019, fell on a Saturday, and the method call dayOfWeek(1, 5, 2019) returns 6. . As another example, January 10 is the tenth day of 2019. As a result, January 10, 2019, fell on a Thursday, and the method call dayOfWeek(1, 10, 2019) returns 4. . In order to calculate this value, two helper methods are provided for you. . firstDayOfYear(year) returns the integer value representing the day of the week for the first day of year, where 0 denotes Sunday, 1 denotes Monday, ..., and 6 denotes Saturday. For example, since 2019 began on a Tuesday, firstDayOfYear(2019) returns 2. | dayOfYear(month, day, year) returns n, where month, day, and year specify the nth day of the year. For the first day of the year, January 1 (month = 1, day = 1), the value 1 is returned. This method accounts for whether year is a leap year. For example, dayOfYear(3, 1, 2017) returns 60, since 2017 is not a leap year, while dayOfYear(3, 1, 2016) returns 61, since 2016 is a leap year. | . Class information for this question . public class APCalendar | private static boolean isLeapYear(int year) | public static int numberOfLeapYears(int year1, int year2) | private static int firstDayOfYear(int year) | private static int dayOfYear(int month, int day, int year) | public static int dayOfWeek(int month, int day, int year) | . Complete method dayOfWeek below. You must use firstDayOfYear and dayOfYear appropriately to receive full credit. . Answer: . /** Returns the value representing the day of the week for the given date * (month, day, year), where 0 denotes Sunday, 1 denotes Monday, ..., * and 6 denotes Saturday. * Precondition: The date represented by month, day, year is a valid date. */ public static int dayOfWeek(int month, int day, int year) { int firstDay = firstDayOfYear(year); int day = dayOfYear(month, day, year); return (firstDay + day - 1) % 7; } . For this, I created two variables and set them to the firstDayOfYear and dayOfYear. After that, I added the two values together and subtracted 1. The % 7 is what the remainder is. .

To create the, an object has to be instantiated to all methods in that class. . Loop Statements . Java has if and while statements that allow for code to be executed with a specific condition. . For a while loop, if the condition is true, the code will continue to run until that same condition is false. . For an if statement, the code will only run once if the condition is true.

This makes it similar to an else-if ladder where it will go through mulitple conditions to see which is true. .

You got ★★★☆☆ . De Morgan&#39;s Law . De Morgan&#39;s Law states that the &quot;!&quot; symbol will negate an And statement and an Or statement. This means that if a condition is written as a || b, !(a || b) would really be a &amp;&amp; b. This goes for the other way around where !(a &amp;&amp; b) is a || b. It will also cause a true statement to be false with !(true) and vice versa. . boolean child = true; boolean hungry = false; if (!(child &amp;&amp; hungry)) { System.out.println(&quot;You have a hungry child&quot;); } else { System.out.println(&quot;Who knows what&#39;s going on?&quot;); } .

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. . Running cells with &#39;Python 3.8.10 64-bit&#39; requires ipykernel package. Run the following command to install &#39;ipykernel&#39; into the Python environment. Command: &#39;/bin/python3 -m pip install ipykernel -U --user --force-reinstall&#39; . put a #collapse-hide flag at the top of any cell if you want to hide that cell by default, but give the reader the option to show it: . import pandas as pd import altair as alt . . put a #collapse-show flag at the top of any cell if you want to show that cell by default, but give the reader the option to hide it: . cars = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/cars.json&#39; movies = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/movies.json&#39; sp500 = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/sp500.csv&#39; stocks = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/stocks.csv&#39; flights = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/flights-5k.json&#39; . . place a #collapse-output flag at the top of any cell if you want to put the output under a collapsable element that is closed by default, but give the reader the option to open it: . print(&#39;The comment #collapse-output was used to collapse the output of this cell by default but you can expand it.&#39;) . The comment #collapse-output was used to collapse the output of this cell by default but you can expand it. . . Interactive Charts With Altair . Charts made with Altair remain interactive.

            "content": "An Example Markdown Post . Basic setup . Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format: . YEAR-MONTH-DAY-filename.md . Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code . You can format text and code per usual . General preformatted text: . # Do a thing do_thing() . Python code and output: . # Prints &#39;2&#39; print(1+1) . 2 . Formatting text as shell commands: . echo &quot;hello world&quot; ./some_script.sh --option &quot;value&quot; wget https://example.com/cat_photo1.png .
