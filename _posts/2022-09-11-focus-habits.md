Notes:
It is highly important to maintain a low stress level. To do this I need to take breaks from class work and spend time to do a hobby or something that I like and that can relieve stress. Most colleges cause a lot of stress to their students.

Note of gratitude:
Dear Mr. Krenz,
I am eternally grateful for your math teachings. You have helped me be the great mathmatician I am today. You are and will always be the best teacher there is. Thank you!

Goals:
* Get straight A's
