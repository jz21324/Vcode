# Extra Credit CSUSM Blog
## Ashley's Background
- Works in Applied Physics
- Got a D in AP Physics as a High School student but still continued to work because she had a passion for it
- Grew up in Palm Springs so wanted to get away from parents
- First person to go to college in family
- Failed in many courses she took throughout college but still continued to persist
- Learned lesson that what your grade is for a certain class doesn't mattter if you're working hard and learning something from it

## John's Background
- Was a bit of a delinquent in high school
- When to palomar college after graduating from high school
- Saved a lot of money than going to a 4-year college
- Transferred to CSUSM
- Majored in Computer Science
- Got a bachelor's along with two associate's degrees
- Did not spend too much time on campus as a student but saw a lot more once he started working there

## CSUSM
- Started as a poultry farm
- potentially more science buildings are being made
- Has lots of different internships in many fields
- Companies in the area are willing to hire young students
- Different majors include:
    - Applied Physics
    - Electronics
    - Biological Sciences
    - Many resources in the Computer Science field
    - Cyber Security
- CSUSM is a smaller campus so changing curriculum is easy
- Computer Science is all very connected to very easy to switch throughout STEM because classes are in sync
- Many math focused fields
- Electtrical and software engineering is popular
- Clubs:
    - Cybersecurity
    - robotics
    - 3D Printing
    - Women in STEM
    - SWE
    - Society of Physics Students

## Internship Aid
- Can range in length from 4 weeks to 4 years
- Can be obtained by:
    - going to campus events 
    - networking
    - joining clubs
    - checking emails
- Make sure to go for paid internships because there are many
- Ask the workers for help if you feel you need some

## How to Pay for College
- Grant is getting money from the government to pay for your educations
- Scholarships are where the colleges privately give you money
- You have to go out and get the scholarships
- Scholarships can be obtained for a variety of reasons
- Grants are based off of economic status
- Subsidized loans are where it is partially paid off by the government
- Unsubsidized loans collect interest over time

## After College
- John got an internship at the safari park
- Some colleges will pay for your masters degree
- They will pay for all of your PhD schooling

## Overall Reflection
After going to this meeting, I learned that what grade you get in a class does not matter as long as you have a passion for a subject. I have experience of failing in certain classes and giving up in that subject because I feel like I'm not good enough. However, because of this I have learned that I just have to keep on working hard and stay persistent. I also learned that computer science is very important in all fields of STEM so it is good that I am taking a computer science class. I plan on going in the STEM field in the future so it helpful that I am learning these things now to prepare me for my future. Ashley and John also taught me that there are many pathways to success so I shouldn't worry about what others are doing as long as I am doing the best in my own life. This presentation overall made me excited for college because it shows me the many opportunities that there are and all the things that I can learn.
