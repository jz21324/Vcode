<p>Throughout all of Mrs. Beveridge's jobs, the companies all had a similar mission statement of trying to help the world by use of technology. Most tech companies' main goal is to create new innovations that encourage helping people and progressing the world. There will be many challenges in this industry and it is important to be willing to adapt to any obstacles or circumstances. On hard thing that Mr. Porter faced was during the interview process. He was given a problem that needed to be solved with code and only given a limited amount of time to complete it. This has taught me that I need to be able to be quick on my feet and face any problem as well as I can. Another interesting thing I learned was that some tech companies will have training schools that you need to go through once you get a job. This is because the technology they use is specific to that company and cannot be learned from anywhere else. This panal definitely helped me learned a first hand example what the tech industry is like. It also showed me what some future jobs may entail that I am interested in. I am very thankful that they came and broadened my perspective of what my future can be.</p>
